#+filetags: unity emacs csharp

Let's skip right to the core of the issue: Unity is designed with the
expectation that you are using Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code for editing
C#, and using alternative editors with features such as LSP gets a bit tricky.
Fortunately, with a lot (a /lot/) of trial and error, I've found a way to
configure the two in a way that /exceeded/ my expectations in how featureful and
pleasant of an experience it is to write code for Unity in Emacs.

An alternate title for this article could also be "Using Unity Editor with LSP
on a non-Windows OS", since a great portion of my difficulty involved figuring
out the idiosyncrasies of running OmniSharp on Linux. This guide still applies
to Windows, though.

* Foreground: What's LSP/OmniSharp?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org-11dec5b3-3b13-48a2-b869-5f29482e1bf3
:END:
In short: LSP (Language Server Protocol) provides almost all of the features you
could ever want from an IDE in any code editor which supports the protocol.
OmniSharp is such a server for C#, and a very powerful one at that. We will go
in depth about how to configure OmniSharp to work with Emacs later.

* Configuring Unity to Open Emacs

The most obvious place to start is configuring Unity to open Emacs as its
external editor. Unfortunately, things aren't so simple, due to a bizarre quirk.
Unity automatically generates and maintains solution and project files, but
/only/ if the external editor is configured to be Visual Studio, Visual Studio
Code, or MonoDevelop, despite the fact that theoretically any number of text
editors can benefit from OmniSharp.

The [[https://github.com/elizagamedev/unity.el][=unity.el=]] package provides a workaround to this issue by providing an
executable named =code= which tricks Unity into always generating the
solution/project files. =code= accepts the command line for the actual program
you wish to run as its arguments. To start =emacsclient=, my "External Script
Editor Args" field is set to the following:

#+begin_src shell
  emacsclient -n +$(Line):$(Column) $(File)
#+end_src

The package also provides some additional quality-of-life features for
interacting with Unity; see the GitHub page for more info on installation and
configuring.

For performance reasons, I would also recommend disabling every option for
"Generate =.csproj= files". OmniSharp will eagerly try to resolve each and every
Unity package, which is usually not necessary.

At this point, Unity will now generate the initial solution/project files when
you click "Regenerate project files" or when you open a C# source file via
Unity. You only need to do this once; Unity will automatically keep them
maintained.

** Prerequisite: (Linux, macOS) Install and Configure Mono
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org-98c9f64c-d551-4e8b-ac90-a8d4704f502d
:END:
The Windows version of Unity will automatically install Visual Studio, which
provides all of the crunchy bits that make OmniSharp work out of the box.
Unfortunately, on other platforms, we have a bit of setup to do. The short
version is that the non-Windows, i.e. Mono-based, distributions of OmniSharp do
not come with a complete set of core assemblies for .NET, so we have to install
those ourselves.

I recommend using the official Mono releases instead of relying on your
distribution's package manager if possible. Luckily, it's quite easy to do so
via the [[https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/][Mono download page]].

Once it's installed, we need to indicate to OmniSharp's =mono= invocation where
these newly installed assemblies can be found, via an environment variable. This
lifesaving piece of advice was provided by GitHub user R0flcopt3r [[https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/1948#issuecomment-694869256][here]]. I simply
set it in my =init.el=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setenv "FrameworkPathOverride" "/lib/mono/4.5")
#+end_src

(The path on macOS is likely different, but I'm not certain.)

** Configuring =csharp-mode= and =lsp-mode=
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org-e8ebf06c-a0d6-4140-a291-3a509f25f74c
:END:
The actual elisp configuration is shockingly simple. (Note: I rely on use
[[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] here.)

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package lsp-mode
    :ensure t
    :bind-keymap
    ("C-c l" . lsp-command-map)
    :custom
    (lsp-keymap-prefix "C-c l"))

  (use-package csharp-mode
    :ensure t
    :init
    (defun my/csharp-mode-hook ()
      (setq-local lsp-auto-guess-root t)
      (lsp))
    (add-hook 'csharp-mode-hook #'my/csharp-mode-hook))
#+end_src

And... that's it, really. There are a lot more awesome options to configure
=lsp-mode=, and I recommend exploring them if you haven't already.

* Other Considerations
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org-f1b7360f-d399-4dd1-96ee-c945be890ff8
:END:
=lsp-mode= gains a massive performance boost if Emacs is built with native JSON
serialization and native elisp compilation. See [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/speed-up-emacs-libjansson-native-elisp-compilation][this article]] for more details. I
/highly/ recommend giving it a try.
